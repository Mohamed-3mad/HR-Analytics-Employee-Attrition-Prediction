# HR Analytics Project

This project analyzes employee data to uncover patterns related to attrition, satisfaction, compensation, and performance. Using Python and Power BI, the goal is to provide actionable insights for HR departments to improve employee retention and workplace satisfaction.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data preprocessing and analysis (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Power BI**: For interactive dashboard and data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For EDA and model development

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes information such as:
- Employee ID
- Age, Gender, Department
- Job Role, Education, Years at Company
- Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction
- Attrition (Yes/No)

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Understand the key factors affecting employee attrition
- Segment employees based on satisfaction, income, and tenure
- Visualize relationships between job roles, income, and turnover
- Provide insights to reduce employee churn

## 📈 Key Visualizations in Power BI Dashboard

1. **Employee Attrition Overview**  
   - Total employees, attrition rate, gender distribution

2. **Income & Satisfaction Analysis**  
   - Monthly income by job role  
   - Job satisfaction by department  

3. **Attrition Factors & Trends**  
   - Years at company vs. attrition  
   - Age distribution of employees leaving  
   - Education level vs. attrition  

## 📌 Insights

- Employees with lower job satisfaction and lower income are more likely to leave.
- Attrition is higher among younger employees and those with fewer years at the company.
- Some departments show consistently higher turnover rates.

## 🚀 Outcome

The analysis supports HR managers in making data-driven decisions by identifying key risk areas for employee attrition and potential focus areas for retention strategies.
